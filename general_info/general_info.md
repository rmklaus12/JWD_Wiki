### General Info

This section will contain info that is not yet catorgised or is general (the grand scheme of all things computer) info.

### The Internet

-   Born in 1969 as ARPANET connecting government agencies and universities
-   The _Internet_ refers to the network of connected computing devices.
-   The _world wide web_ came about in 1989 and is a collection of interlinked websites and other web resources.
-   Web browsers came about in the 1990s
-   _jQuery_ was the first JS framework to fetch data without page refresh
-   _Frameworks_ enable user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.

### CS concepts

-   What is programming? _Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute._
-   _Programming_ is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
-   _Programming is the act of telling a computer what to do._
-   An _algorithm_ is a sequence of steps that the computer follows to solve a problem.
-   Algorithms have three main characteristics
    -   They are **sequential**: performed step by step from start to finish.
    -   They are **conditional**: perform certain steps based on conditions of the system.
    -   They are **generalizable**: applicable to many different problems that are of a similar type.
-   _Coding_ is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.
-   _separation of concerns_ - problems or features are organized in a way that makes code easy to understand and maintain.

### Data Types

-   _Data_ is a basic unit in programming.
-   In computing, data is the pieces of information that we use to build programs, like the numbers in a calculation, or the text printed to a screen.
-   _Data types_ are exactly what they sound like: different types of data. Data types tell us about the data, including how it can be stored and what types of operations we can perform.
-   Categorizing information using _data types_ is a way for a computer to distinguish different types of input.
    -   _Primitives_ are the simplest data types and are shared across many programming languages. They include:
    -   _Numbers_ — values that allow us to do calculations and keep count.
    -   _Strings_ — a sequence of characters or symbols often used to denote text.
    -   _Booleans_ — logical values that represent the idea of true or false.

### Operators

-   Operators are different symbols that represent an _operation_, such as the plus sign (`+`) as a symbol for addition. Operations enable us to _process_ our data, to transform it into something else.
-   Making calculations using _arithmetic_ operators.
-   Comparing information using _comparison_ operators.
-   Creating logical expressions using _logical_ (aka Boolean) operators.
-   Logical operators include:
    -   _AND_ — both expressions evaluate to true, so the final result is true:
    -   `((4 > 1) AND (2 < 7))` is the same as `(TRUE AND TRUE)`. Evaluates to true.
    -   _OR_ — one of the expressions evalutes to true, so the final result is true:
    -   `((8 > 6) OR (3 > 6))` is the same as `(TRUE OR FALSE)`. Evaluates to true.
    -   _NOT_ — an expression, no matter its logical value, evaluates to the opposite:
    -   `NOT (1 < 3)` evaluates to `NOT (TRUE)`. Evaluates to false.

### Control Flow

-   _Control flow_ is the order in which instructions are executed.
-   _Control structures_ alter control flow in a program. You learned three structures, each suited for a different scenario:
-   _Conditional:_ “if some condition is met, then do X. Otherwise, do Y”.
-   _Loop:_ “do something Z number of times” or “do something repeatedly until some condition is met”.
-   _Exception:_ “do steps A, B, C. If an error occurs, stop, and do steps J, K, L”.

### Front-end Review (Codecademy)

-   The front-end of a website or application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a client, like a web browser.
-   A web server is a process running on a computer somewhere that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.
-   Storing, accessing, and manipulating data is a large part of a web application’s back-end
-   Data is stored in databases which can be relational databases or NoSQL databases.
-   The server-side of a web application, sometimes called the application server, handles important tasks such as authorization and authentication.
-   The back-end of web application often has a web API which is a way of interacting with an application’s data through HTTP requests and responses.
-   Together the technologies used to build the front-end and back-end of a web application are known as the stack, and many different languages and frameworks can be used to build a robust back-end.

### Problem Solving

**7-step problem solving framework**

1. Define the problem
2. Come up with solutions
3. Do research but don't reinvent the wheel
    - figure out which questions to ask and which existing resources you can pull from to implement your solutions
4. Think about and choose a solution
    - create a [decision matrix](https://toggl.com/blog/decision-matrix)
5. Take action
6. Hit singles
    - do a few things well rather than a lot of things with medicore execution or reults. Stick to targeted focus rather than perfection and drilling into every little piece. Quality over quantity.
7. Respect your time
    - delegate around your limitations
