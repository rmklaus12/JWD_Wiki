## Random Color Picker
In this project, we’ll build a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.

Our program will set the screen’s background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color.  [Random generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies)  are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.
