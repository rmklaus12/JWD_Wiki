## Authorization Form

A client just called you to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see.
They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form. In this project, you’ll accomplish this by using a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.

### Tasks
1.   The contact info in the browser looks fine, but it should be hidden until you enter a password! 
2. Look in the code editor. You can see a  `Contact`  component class.  `Contact`‘s instructions object has three methods:  `constructor()`,  `.authorize()`, and  `.render()`.

`constructor()`  is a special method. You’ll learn about it in the next unit. For now, just know that you can check whether a user has entered the right password by running the expression  `this.state.authorized`.
