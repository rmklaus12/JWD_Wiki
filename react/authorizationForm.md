## Authorization Form

A client just called you to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see.
They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form. In this project, you’ll accomplish this by using a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.

### Tasks
1.   The contact info in the browser looks fine, but it should be hidden until you enter a password! 
Look in the code editor. You can see a  `Contact`  component class.  `Contact`‘s instructions object has three methods:  `constructor()`,  `.authorize()`, and  `.render()`.
`constructor()`  is a special method. You’ll learn about it in the next unit. For now, just know that you can check whether a user has entered the right password by running the expression  `this.state.authorized`.
2. Let’s start with the  `<h1></h1>`  in the render function.
Right now, the  `<h1></h1>`  displays the text  `Contact`. If a user hasn’t been authorized, then you want the  `<h1></h1>`  to display  `Enter the Password`  instead.
Make the  `<h1></h1>`  display  `Contact`  _only_  if  `this.state.authorized`  is true. If  `this.state.authorized`  is false, then the  `<h1></h1>`  should display  `Enter the Password`.
3.   The browser should say ‘Enter the Password.’
To make sure it’s working properly, edit the  `constructor()`  method so that the user is authorized:
```
	constructor(props) {  
		super(props);  
		this.state = {  
			password: 'swordfish',  
			authorized: true  
		};  
		this.authorize = this.authorize.bind(this);  
	}
```

This should change the text back to ‘Contact’.
If it works, then make sure to change  `authorized`  back to  `false`!
4. If the user isn’t authorized, then you want them to see a login form into which they can enter a password. Let’s make that login form!
In the  `.render()`  method, before the  `return`  statement, declare a new variable named  `login`.
Set  `login`  equal to a JSX  `<form></form>`  element. This  `<form></form>`  is going to have multiple children, so wrap it in parentheses!
Give the  `<form></form>`  an attribute of  `action="#"`.
5.   Good! Now let’s give your form some  `<input />`s for the user to fill out.
In between the  `<form></form>`  tags, write two  `<input />`  tags. Give the first  `<input />`  two attributes:  `type="password"`  and  `placeholder="Password"`. Give the second  `<input />`  one attribute:  `type="submit"`.
6.   Now let’s hide the contact info.
	After your  `login`  variable, declare another variable named  `contactInfo`. Set it equal to empty parentheses:
```
const contactInfo = (  
  
);  
return (
```
Cut the  `<ul></ul>`  out of the return statement, and paste it in between those parentheses!
7.   Great! By saving two JSX expressions as variables, you’ve set yourself up nicely to toggle between them.
In the render function’s  `return`  statement, make a new line right below the  `<h1></h1>`. On this new line, use a ternary operator. If  `this.state.authorized`  is true, make the ternary return  `contactInfo`. Otherwise, make the ternary return  `login`.
8.   On lines 14 through 21, you can see a method named  `.authorize()`.
This method will check whether a submitted password is equal to ‘swordfish’. If it is, then  `this.state.authorized`  will become  `true`.
You need  `authorize`  to get called whenever a user hits “Submit!”
Give the  `<form></form>`  an  `onSubmit`  attribute. Set the attribute’s  _value_  equal to the  `authorize`  function.
9.   Try entering an incorrect password and hitting ‘Submit.’ Nothing should happen.
Now try entering ‘swordfish.’ Your screen should change!
